# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### V6 404 路由无法显示
报错：Import in body of module; reorder to top import/first

解决：将import "../style/type.css";放在所有业务前面

jsonserver
1.安装json-server
npm install -g json-server
json-server -v
2.创建db.json
在文件夹下创建一个db.json文件，存放一些数据。
3.启动json-server
cd sites/adminnews/src/db
在文件夹下，直接在地址栏cmd，进入终端。执行启动json-server命令。
json-server --watch db.json --port 8000
4.在浏览器中输入地址：http://localhost:+端口号/接口名称，即可查看数据。
例如：输入http://localhost:5000/comments
axios.get  axios.post   axios.patch   axios.put axios.delete

1.路由拦截问题
2.手动del token 报错
3.优化userlist编辑 添加表单用同一个
4.根据路由权限显示可点击的路由
5.NewsPublish 通用组件把 button 属性改成传  type 123试试
